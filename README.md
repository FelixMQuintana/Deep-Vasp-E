# Deep VASP-E: A Flexible Analysis of Electrostatic Isopotentials for Finding and Explaining Mechanisms that Control Binding Specificity


## GRAD++ CAM
Visualization technique used in this project is Grad CAM++(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11063).

![The S1 cavity of atlantic salmon trypsin (1a0j) is predominantly occupied with a negative isopotential (transparent yellow surface) generated by aspartate 189 (spheres).  The most salient 150 voxels identified by DeepVASP-E are illustrated as teal cubes in \textbf{a}.  This region is the area closest to D189 that maintains solvent accessibility in most conformations of the MD simulation.  In \textbf{b}, voxels colored red, yellow, green, and blue, illustrate regions of descending salience.](https://github.com/FelixMQuintana/Deep-Vasp-E/blob/main/TrypsinFigure_v2.png)

## Project structure
#### Models
Models package is responsible in holding different models being used for different projects. Note, models do not do any 
hypertuning of hyperparameters. Keras has tuners available. 

#### processing
Package is responsible for preprocessing dataset and postprocessing model results (Grad CAM++).

## Dataset structure

Dataset structure for loading in training and test set is done with the following format:
                `Dataset_directory/protein001/protein001_example001.CNN`
Currently, implementation requires code to specify the evaluation set following a leave one out approach.
